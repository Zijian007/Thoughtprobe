[{"text": "Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?\nAnswer:\n2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber = 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber.\n\nThis is a simple problem that can be solved by using the distributive property.  The distributive property states that a number multiplied by a sum is equal to the sum of the number multiplied by each addend.  In this case, the number is 2 and the sum is 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  The distributive property can be written as:\n\n2(2 bolts of blue fiber + half that much white fiber) = 2 bolts of blue fiber + 2(half that much white fiber)\n\nThe distributive property can be used to solve this problem because it allows us to multiply each addend by the number.  In this case, the number is 2 and the addends are 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  The distributive property can be used to solve this problem because it allows us to multiply each addend by the number.
