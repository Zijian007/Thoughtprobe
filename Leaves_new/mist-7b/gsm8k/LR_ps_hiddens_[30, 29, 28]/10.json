How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?\nAnswer: We first need to find the number of downloads in the second month. We know that the number of downloads in the second month was three times as\nmany as the downloads in the first month. So, we can write:\n\n60 \u00d7 3 = x\n\n60 \u00d7 3 = x\n\n180 = x\n\nSo, the number of downloads in the second month was 180.\n\nWe also know that the number of downloads in the third month was 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month. So, we can write:\n\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = x\n\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = x\n\n126 = x\n\nSo, the number of downloads in the third month was 126.\n\nWe can now add the number of downloads in the first, second, and third months to find the total number of downloads over the three months.\n\n60 + 180 + 126 = x\n\n60 + 180 + 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 366.", "scores": [1.3643933534622192, 3.527097702026367, 2.6420116424560547, 4.221763610839844, 3.7588512897491455, 1.4739412069320679, 2.7692089080810547, 4.231774806976318, 2.924818992614746]}]
