The total time is 2 hours and 10 minutes.\n\nTo convert the time to hours, we need to divide the time by 60 minutes.\n\n2 hours and 10 minutes = 2 hours + 10 minutes\n\n2 hours + 10 minutes = 2 hours + 10 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes\n\n2 hours + 10 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes = 2 hours + 10 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes \u00d7 1 hour\n\n2 hours + 10 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes \u00d7 1 hour = 2 hours + 10 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes \u00d7 1 hour \u00d7 1 hour\n\n2 hours + 10 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes \u00d7 1 hour \u00d7 1 hour = 2 hours + 10 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes \u00d7 1 hour \u00d7 1 hour \u00d7 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 hours + 10 minutes \u00f7", "scores": [0.5364604592323303, 3.1276447772979736, 3.519927978515625, 2.8998985290527344, 2.0017967224121094, 2.296217203140259, 1.5777193307876587, 2.0001165866851807, 0.9546313881874084]}, {"text": "Question: Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail.
