[{"text": "Question: Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots.

Since Gloria has to choose between the boots and the two pairs of heels, the price of the boots must be greater than or equal to the price of the two pairs of heels. That is, \\(x\\geq 33+2x\\).
