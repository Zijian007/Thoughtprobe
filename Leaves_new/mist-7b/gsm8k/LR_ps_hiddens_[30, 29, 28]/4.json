[{"text": "Question: Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\nAnswer: The solution to this problem is 10 cups.\n\nThe first step in solving this problem is to determine the number of cups of feed that Wend will need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.  This can be done by adding the number of cups of feed that she gives her chickens in the morning and the number of cups of feed that she gives her chickens in the afternoon.  This gives a total of 40 cups of feed.  The next step is to divide this total by the number of chickens in Wendi's flock.  This gives a total of 2 cups of feed per chicken.  The final step is to multiply this total by the number of chickens in Wendi's flock.  This gives a total of 40 cups of feed.  The final answer is 10 cups of feed. si\u0119 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8 si\u00e8", "pred": "10", "gt": 20.0, "metrics": {"First Score": 1.0426758527755737, "Last Score": 2.609865188598633, "Range": 2.8195868730545044, "Standard Deviation": 0.7391496265869311, "Variance": 0.5463421704835996, "Mean": 2.6447384506464005, "Sum": 21.157907605171204, "Coefficient of Variation": 0.2794792908184458, "Mean Absolute Deviation": 0.47901467978954315, "Max Step Change": 1.5305651426315308, "RMS Fluctuation": 0.7391496265869311, "Autocorrelation (Lag 1)": -0.008410612895116054, "Average Difference": 0.2238841908318656, "Increase Ratio": 0.5714285714285714, "Decrease Ratio": 0.42857142857142855, "Kendall Tau": 0.14285714285714285}, "full_text": "Question: Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.

She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals.  In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  The size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens.\n\nWe can use the information that Wendi gives her chickens three cups of feed in each meal to find the total number of cups of feed that she gives her chickens in a day.  We can use the information that she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon to find the total number of cups of feed that she gives her chickens in a day.
