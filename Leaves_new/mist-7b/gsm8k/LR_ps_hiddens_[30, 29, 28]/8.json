How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\nAnswer: We first need to find the total distance traveled in the first 3 hours.  We know that the distance traveled is equal to the speed times the time traveled.  So, we can write:\n\nd = 60mph * 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nWe also know that the distance traveled is equal to the speed times the time traveled.  So, we can write:\n\nd = 80mph * 2 hours = 160 miles\n\nWe also know that the distance traveled is equal to the speed times the time traveled.
